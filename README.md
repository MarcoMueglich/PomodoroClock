# PomodoroClock

A Pomodoro clock is used to make one's work more productive and structured. It divides working time into productive times and break times. 

The application displays the remaining time in each phase and shows which phase you are in through audio-visual feedback.

Vanilla CSS and Vanilla Javascript (ES6) were used to develop and design the application.
